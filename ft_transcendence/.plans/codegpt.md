Plan for the Base Implementation
1. Backend (PHP)
Implement a basic PHP backend (without frameworks).
Use Docker to containerize the PHP server.
Set up a simple REST API for future expansion.
Use .env for environment variables (e.g., database credentials, security keys).
Implement basic security (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection protection).
Establish HTTPS/WSS support.
2. Frontend (TypeScript)
Implement a single-page application (SPA).
Use Vanilla TypeScript without frameworks for now.
Set up modular components for future extensions.
Implement a router system that supports browser navigation (Back/Forward buttons).
3. Database
Use SQLite or MySQL, following the constraints.
Implement basic models for users and game sessions.
4. Docker Setup
Define a Dockerfile for the PHP backend.
Define a Dockerfile for the TypeScript frontend.
Use Docker Compose to orchestrate services.
Full Base Implementation
I'll create a complete base structure including:

backend/ (PHP REST API)
frontend/ (TypeScript SPA)
docker/ (Docker setup)
.env.example for environment variables
Let's begin.

Answer in chat instead
The base docker-compose.yml is now set up, defining services for the backend (PHP) and frontend (TypeScript). Next, let's implement the backend in PHP and the frontend in TypeScript. Do you want a minimal API setup for the backend first?
