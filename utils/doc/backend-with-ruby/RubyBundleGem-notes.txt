(in app.rb)

require 'bundler/setup'	# Load Bundler
Bundler.require			# Require all gems from Gemfile

# Run Your App with Bundler Since gems are inside vendor/bundle, run:

	bundle exec ruby app.rb

# If you don't want to type bundle exec every time, you can enable Bundler automatically in your shell:

	export RUBYOPT='-rbundler/setup'

# Then, restart your terminal or run:

	source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc

# Now, ruby app.rb should work without needing bundle exec
